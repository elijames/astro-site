# Atomic Design Components

This directory follows atomic design principles to organize components in a hierarchical and logical manner. The structure helps maintain a scalable and maintainable component library.

## Directory Structure

### `/atoms`
Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. In interfaces, they are our HTML tags, such as form labels, inputs, buttons, etc.
- Basic HTML elements
- Simple UI components
- Single responsibility
- No dependencies on other components

### `/molecules`
Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound.
- Simple combinations of atoms
- Small, focused components
- Reusable across different contexts
- Limited responsibilities

### `/organisms`
Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.
- More complex UI components
- Built from multiple molecules and/or atoms
- Form distinct sections of the interface
- Specific context within the application

### `/templates`
Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.
- Page-level objects
- Focus on content structure
- No real content, just content structure
- Made of organisms, molecules, and atoms

## Best Practices

1. Components should be placed in the appropriate atomic level based on their complexity and responsibilities
2. Each component should be self-contained with its own styles and logic
3. Use index files in each directory for better import organization
4. Components should be composable and reusable where possible
5. Maintain consistent naming conventions across all levels
